# Calculator
Small calculator app with a GUI

## Descritption
This was my first time learning to use TKinter and seeing what it can do. It functions as a veyr basic calculator and can even catch erorrs (like if someone was to divide by 0). 
TKinter is now part of python and does not require any further installation.
